        <h1>The Undead</h1>
        <p>
            The undead are denizens of evil.  They have been summoned by their necromancer masters to do their bidding. Throughout Sosaria in the graveyards and crypts of long-forgotten ruins, these minions do their masters' work. They fight off the unwanted visitors that may disrupt their masters.  They guard the entryways to forgotten knowledge.  
            Some are unbound by the necromancers they used to serve.  Now they roam and attack with no reservation anyone who comes close.  Some claw their way to you, and others cast powerful magic bestowed upon them from their prior masters. Others are raised from fierce dragonsâ€™ guard treasures and relics of the past. These are not to be underestimated as their power can quickly overwhelm you as they call additional undead to aid them. 
            In some graveyards, you may find their masters layer, slay these undead and their master will awaken.  Put an end to this dark magic, or perhaps gain the knowledge of their masters to wield these minions for your own doing. Either way, you must prepare yourself to stop their claws and resist their magic.  Arm yourself with the weapons and armor to help you defeat them.  It is told that silver runes etched into armor will protect you the best. The finest silver weapons crafted by master blacksmiths will make quick work of the undead.
