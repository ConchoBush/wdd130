    <p>Hello Everyone! I am so glad to be a part of this class and learning how to create my own web pages.  
        I have had some great ideas that I am looking to explore during this course.</p>
    <p>I currently live on the East Coast of Florida.  
        The beach is 10 min away and I love it.  I have a wonderful wife and 3 children. The oldest is a boy and he is 13.  
        My other 2 are girls and they are 10 and 6.  My wife really enjoys dressing up for halloween, yes that picture is halloween and not christmas.
        I enjoy playing video games, board games, and cooking.   
        I think it is so great to have people over, eat some amazing food, and then play a few games together.</p>
    <p>I look forward to learning with each of you this semester and sharing our great ideas and creations.  
    </p>
