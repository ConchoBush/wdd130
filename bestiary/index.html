            The land of Sosaria is riddled with beasts and monsters of all kinds.  This tome of knowledge showcases the research done by brave adventurers and provides it to you. Lives have been lost in the crypts, caves, dungeons, and marshes of Sosaria to bring you this knowledge.  Protect it, share it, and learn from its pages so you can prepare yourself for the encounters ahead. 
            In this tome, you will unlock the secrets of the undead.  You will discover where they come from. How to combat them, how to protect yourself from them, and how you can possibly control them. You will learn of the many types that wander this world. Their strengths and weaknesses and the knowledge they guard. 
            You will also learn of the reptilian creatures that slither on the ground or fly in the air.  They hold vast secrets and diligent adventurers have uncovered the knowledge of the dragons and how to obtain their eggs to raise them as protectors.  With this, you can fight off the creatures and people that would do you harm in this world. 
            This and so much more can be found in the pages of this tome.  May your adventures be full of rewards.
