      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To provide a bestiary reference guide for a vidoe game that I enjoy playing.  This will provide a more detailed guide on stats that monsters within the game have.
        The bestiary will be split up into different monster families or types to allow for navigation and page seperation. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience will be the player based community for this game. There are several thousand active players in the game, so it is a fairly small community that enjoys this game and may find the information useful. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>UO Forever Bestiary</h3>
      <p>
        The land of Sosaria is riddled with beasts and monsters of all kinds.  This tome of knowledge showcases the research done by brave adventurers and provides it to you. Lives have been lost in the crypts, caves, dungeons, and marshes of Sosaria to bring you this knowledge.  Protect it, share it, and learn from its pages so you can prepare yourself for the encounters ahead. 
        In this tome, you will unlock the secrets of the undead.  You will discover where they come from. How to combat them, how to protect yourself from them, and how you can possibly control them. You will learn of the many types that wander this world. Their strengths and weaknesses and the knowledge they guard. 
        You will also learn of the reptilian creatures that slither on the ground or fly in the air.  They hold vast secrets and diligent adventurers have uncovered the knowledge of the dragons and how to obtain their eggs to raise them as protectors.  With this, you can fight off the creatures and people that would do you harm in this world. 
        This and so much more can be found in the pages of this tome.  May your adventures be full of rewards.

      <h3>The Undead</h3>
      <p>
        The undead are denizens of evil.  They have been summoned by their necromancer masters to do their bidding. Throughout Sosaria in the graveyards and crypts of long-forgotten ruins, these minions do their masters' work. They fight off the unwanted visitors that may disrupt their masters.  They guard the entryways to forgotten knowledge.  
        Some are unbound by the necromancers they used to serve.  Now they roam and attack with no reservation anyone who comes close.  Some claw their way to you, and others cast powerful magic bestowed upon them from their prior masters. Others are raised from fierce dragonsâ€™ guard treasures and relics of the past. These are not to be underestimated as their power can quickly overwhelm you as they call additional undead to aid them. 
        In some graveyards, you may find their masters layer, slay these undead and their master will awaken.  Put an end to this dark magic, or perhaps gain the knowledge of their masters to wield these minions for your own doing. Either way, you must prepare yourself to stop their claws and resist their magic.  Arm yourself with the weapons and armor to help you defeat them.  It is told that silver runes etched into armor will protect you the best. The finest silver weapons crafted by master blacksmiths will make quick work of the undead.

      <h3>The Reptiles</h3>
      <p>
        Reptiles come in many varieties.  They can be the snakes that roam the forests or the giant snakes in the marshes of Sosaria.  They are the lizardmen that have built civilizations on the outskirts of lakes and bogs. Or they are the majestic and highly intelligent dragons that soar through the air or guard the vast caves full of treasure.  Some have found ancient portals that transport you to long-forgotten dragon roosts. As you adventure through Sosaria it is best to be prepared for these creatures at all times. 
        In the caves and lairs of great beasts, you will find the dragons of Sosaria.  They can be the infant drakes, young dragons, normal dragons, or the ancient wyrms of myth.  Some adventurers claim to have found ancient guardians throughout the land that protect vast amounts of knowledge, relics, and eggs of their kind.  If it is the riches of these beasts you are after then it is best to prepare yourself with the correct weapons and armor.  It is said that the runes of punt etched into armor will protect you from reptiles. The finest reptile slayer weapons can be crafted by master blacksmiths and will make quick work of all reptiles you may come across.
